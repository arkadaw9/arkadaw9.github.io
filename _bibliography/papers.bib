  title={AI-generated Image Detection: Passive or Watermark?},
  author={Guo, Moyang and Hu, Yuepeng and Jiang, Zhengyuan and Li, Zeyu and Sadovnik, Amir and Daw, Arka and Gong, Neil},
  abstract={While text-to-image models offer numerous benefits, they also pose significant societal risks. Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for mitigating these risks. Detection methods can be broadly categorized into passive and watermark-based approaches: passive detectors rely on artifacts present in AI-generated images, whereas watermark-based detectors proactively embed watermarks into such images. A key question is which type of detector performs better in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge that gap by developing ImageDetectBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to compare the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of passive and watermark-based detectors. Our benchmark includes four datasets, each containing a mix of AI-generated and non-AI-generated images. We evaluate five passive detectors and four watermark-based detectors against eight types of common perturbations and three types of adversarial perturbations. Our benchmark results reveal several interesting findings. For instance, watermark-based detectors consistently outperform passive detectors, both in the presence and absence of perturbations. Based on these insights, we provide recommendations for detecting AI-generated images, e.g., when both types of detectors are applicable, watermark-based detectors should be the preferred choice.},

  title={Hiding-in-Plain-Sight (HiPS) Attack on CLIP for Targetted Object Removal from Images},
  author={Daw, Arka and Chung, Megan Hong-Thanh and Mahbub, Maria and Sadovnik, Amir},
  abstract={Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but traditional attacks have mostly focused on single-modalities. With the rise of large multi-modal models (LMMs) like CLIP, which combine vision and language capabilities, new vulnerabilities have emerged. However, prior work in multimodal targeted attacks aim to completely change the model's output to what the adversary wants. In many realistic scenarios, an adversary might seek to make only subtle modifications to the output, so that the changes go unnoticed by downstream models or even by humans. We introduce Hiding-in-Plain-Sight (HiPS) attacks, a novel class of adversarial attacks that subtly modifies model predictions by selectively concealing target object(s), as if the target object was absent from the scene. We propose two HiPS attack variants, HiPS-cls and HiPS-cap, and demonstrate their effectiveness in transferring to downstream image captioning models, such as CLIP-Cap, for targeted object removal from image captions.},

  title={Masking the Gaps: An Imputation-Free Approach to Time Series Modeling with Missing Data},
  author={Neog, Abhilash and Daw, Arka and Khorasgani, Sepideh Fatemi and Karpatne, Anuj},
  abstract={A significant challenge in time-series (TS) modelling is presence of missing values in real-world TS datasets. Traditional two-stage frameworks, involving imputation followed by modeling, suffer from two key drawbacks: (1) the propagation of imputation errors into subsequent TS modeling, (2) the trade-offs between imputation efficacy and imputation complexity. While one-stage approaches attempt to address these limitations, they often struggle with scalability or fully leveraging partially observed features. To this end, we propose a novel imputation-free approach for handling missing values in time series termed \textbf{Miss}ing Feature-aware \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{M}odeling (\textbf{MissTSM}) with two main innovations. \textit{First}, we develop a novel embedding scheme that treats every combination of time-step and feature (or channel) as a distinct token. \textit{Second}, we introduce a novel \textit{Missing Feature-Aware Attention (MFAA) Layer} to learn latent representations at every time-step based on partially observed features. We evaluate the effectiveness of MissTSM in handling missing values over multiple benchmark datasets.},

  title={A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations},
  author={Gupta, Naveen and Sawhney, Medha and Daw, Arka and Lin, Youzuo and Karpatne, Anuj},
  abstract={In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.},

  abstract={A grand challenge in biology is to discover evolutionary traits - features of organisms common to a group of species with a shared ancestor in the tree of life (also referred to as phylogenetic tree). With the growing availability of image repositories in biology, there is a tremendous opportunity to discover evolutionary traits directly from images in the form of a hierarchy of prototypes. However, current prototype-based methods are mostly designed to operate over a flat structure of classes and face several challenges in discovering hierarchical prototypes, including the issue of learning over-specific features at internal nodes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the framework of Hierarchy aligned Commonality through Prototypical Networks (HComP-Net). We empirically show that HComP-Net learns prototypes that are accurate, semantically consistent, and generalizable to unseen species in comparison to baselines on birds, butterflies, and fishes datasets.},

  abstract={Images are increasingly becoming the currency for documenting biodiversity on the planet, providing novel opportunities for accelerating scientific discoveries in the field of organismal biology, especially with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). We ask if pre-trained VLMs can aid scientists in answering a range of biologically relevant questions without any additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs in the field of organismal biology using a novel dataset, VLM4Bio, consisting of 469K question-answer pairs involving 30K images from three groups of organisms: fishes, birds, and butterflies, covering five biologically relevant tasks. We also explore the effects of applying prompting techniques and tests for reasoning hallucination on the performance of VLMs, shedding new light on the capabilities of current SOTA VLMs in answering biologically relevant questions using images.

  abstract={Fishes are integral to both ecological systems and economic sectors, and studying fish traits is crucial for understanding biodiversity patterns and macro-evolution trends. To enable the analysis of visual traits from fish images, we introduce the Fish-Visual Trait Analysis (Fish-Vista) dataset - a large, annotated collection of about 60K fish images spanning 1900 different species, supporting several challenging and biologically relevant tasks including species classification, trait identification, and trait segmentation. These images have been curated through a sophisticated data processing pipeline applied to a cumulative set of images obtained from various museum collections. Fish-Vista provides fine-grained labels of various visual traits present in each image. It also offers pixel-level annotations of 9 different traits for 2427 fish images, facilitating additional trait segmentation and localization tasks. The ultimate goal of Fish-Vista is to provide a clean, carefully curated, high-resolution dataset that can serve as a foundation for accelerating biological discoveries using advances in AI. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on Fish-Vista.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
