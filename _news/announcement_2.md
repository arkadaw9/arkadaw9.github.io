Four new papers on Arxiv:

    1. [ImageDetechBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13553): A benchmark to compare the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of passive and watermark based detectors for text-to-image models.
    2. [HComp-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02335): An explainability tool for discovering evolutionary traits as hierarchical prototypes.
    3. [FishVista](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08027): A benchmark dataset for identifying biological traits from images.
    4. [GFI for Seismic Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11247): A generalized framework for forward and inverse problems in seismic imaging that achieves SOTA performance.
