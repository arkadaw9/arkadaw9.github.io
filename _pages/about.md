Hi there! I am a **Distinguished Staff Fellow** at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and a member of the Center for AI Security Research (CAISER). My research spans several key areas in deep learning, including AI safety, multimodal foundation models, generative AI, and applications of AI for real-world scientific problems. I did my Ph.D. from Virginia Tech on uncertainty quantification for Physics-informed Machine Learning, where I was advised by <a href='https://anujkarpatne.github.io/'>Anuj Karpatne</a>.

Generally, I am passionate about everything related to deep learning and artificial intelligence. My current research focusses on enhancing the generalizability, robustness and reliability of deep learning models to ensure their safety and trustworthiness. I am also working on developing large-scale foundational models tailored for ecological systems (such as lakes and streams) and geospatial applications (including satellite imagery). 

I have also experience working in the industry as a research intern at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY (2022) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Seattle (2021). In 2023, I was honored with the <a href='https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Funding/fellowships.html'>Kafura Graduate Fellowship</a> from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics Engineering from Jadavpur University.
